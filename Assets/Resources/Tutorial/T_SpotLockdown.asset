  text: "If an NPC\u2019s alert level is maxed out, they would lock down the camera.\r\n\nLockdown
    stops you from controlling the camera for a while before resetting you back to
    the start of the level.  Your clearance level will be reduced as well.\r\n\nTo
    avoid being locked out, you must switch away the affected camera.\r\n"
